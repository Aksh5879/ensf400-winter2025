# ensf400-winter2025
This repository contains the ENSF 400 Winter 2025 course project, where we implement a CI/CD pipeline for an open-source application. The project involves GitHub workflows, containerization (Docker), automated testing, and Jenkins integration to streamline deployment and validation processes.


- **Version Control & Collaboration** using GitHub
- **Containerization** with Docker
- **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)** using Jenkins
- **Automated Testing & Code Quality Checks** (SonarQube, JMeter, DependencyCheck)
- **Documentation & Demo** to showcase the pipeline workflow
