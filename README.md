# ensf400-winter2025
This repository contains the ENSF 400 Winter 2025 course project, where we implement a CI/CD pipeline for an open-source application. The project involves GitHub workflows, containerization (Docker), automated testing, and Jenkins integration to streamline deployment and validation processes.


- **Version Control & Collaboration** using GitHub
- **Containerization** with Docker
- **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)** using Jenkins
- **Automated Testing & Code Quality Checks** (SonarQube, JMeter, DependencyCheck)
- **Documentation & Demo** to showcase the pipeline workflow

## Project Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Aksh5879/ensf400-winter2025.git
   cd ensf400-winter2025

## Docker testing
1)Docker was built successfully and took 82.5 seconds to build.
2)Docker ran smoothly without any errors and with the help of port forwarding, an URL was created which opened in web browser.
